# Sales Forecast Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a dynamic sales dashboard built in Microsoft Power BI. It is based on a simulated dataset that represents daily sales data from a concrete product manufacturing business. The purpose of the dashboard is to provide interactive visual insights and a short-term forecast to support inventory and planning decisions.

## Key Features

- 30-day future sales forecast using Power BI’s built-in analytics tools
- Product-based revenue comparison with bar charts
- Time series visualizations to analyze seasonal trends
- KPI cards showing total revenue, average sales, and today's sales (using DAX)
- Conditional formatting heatmap for visual intensity mapping by product and date
- Interactive slicers for date and product filtering

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes one year of synthetic daily sales data and contains the following fields:

- **Date**: Daily sales transaction date
- **Product**: Product type (e.g., Parke 8cm, C25 Beton, etc.)
- **Quantity**: Units sold on that day
- **Unit Price**: Predefined price per product
- **Total Sales**: Calculated field (Quantity × Unit Price)

The data was generated to simulate realistic sales patterns for dashboard testing and visualization purposes.
